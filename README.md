# CIS 162 Final

### Abstract

You have been asked to develop a program to process a companyâ€™s payroll.   Payroll is paid bi-weekly.  There are three phases to this task.  The first is to read a series of time card records and create a file that will be used to process the payroll.  The second is to process the file you created and create a file that can be used to produce the check to the employee.  There are several subsidiary files that you will use in the processing of the payroll.  Finally, you will develop a GUI program to display the check data.  See file formats at the end of this document.
